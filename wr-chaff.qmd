# Introduction

A number of subspecies of the common chaffinch, Fringilla
coelebs, have been described based principally on the differences in the pattern and colour of the adult male plumage. Two of groups of these
subspecies are the "coelebs group"  that occurs in Europe
and Asia and the "canariensis group" that occurs on
the Canary Islands.
